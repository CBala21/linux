	Specifies the default pre-allocated buffer-size in kB for the
	HD-audio driver.  A larger buffer (e.g. 2048) is preferred
	for systems using PulseAudio.  The default 64 is chosen just
	for compatibility reasons.

	Note that the pre-allocation size can be changed dynamically
	via a proc file (/proc/asound/card*/pcm*/sub*/prealloc), too.
